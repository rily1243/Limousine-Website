# Limousine-Website
The front-end design of a simple limousine rental website. 

This is a simple front-end design for a limousine website. It currently lacks back-end functionalities, such as a user database to handle sign-up and log-in functions. Instead, it uses console logs for user data. For the sign-up and login functions to work properly, it needs a database, such as MongoDB, or a live server database.
